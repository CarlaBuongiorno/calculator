# **Calculator**

## Goal
Build a calculator program from scratch to practice software design and increase familiarity with solving problems in code.


## Requirements:

- Must be able to input the calculation as provided on the command line.
- Must be able to do addition.
- Must be able to do substraction.
- Must be able to do multiplication.
- Must be able to do division (floating point, so with decimal numbers).
- Must follow the standard order of operator precedence (multiplication and division first, then substraction and addition).
- Should be able to make calculations of arbitrary length (2+3+5+6+.... and so on. I have to be able to make it as long as I want).
- Should be able to handle incorrect input (don't crash/handle exceptions) and inform the user that they made a mistake. There is no need to show what the mistake is.

### Nice To Have:
- Would like to have a legenda/help text telling you what you can provide as input.
- Would like to have the the floating point decimals limited to 10 decimals at most to avoid filling the screen.
- Would like to have tests for the program (test per function and the program as a whole, you do not have to test reading the input but do make it so you can test processing the input).
